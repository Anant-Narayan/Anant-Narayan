    <ul type="square">
      <li><h3>Absolute scale temperature</li></h3>
<p>A temperature scale, zero of which is equivalent to -273.15 °C and 373.15 °C is equivalent to 100 °C, is called absolute scale of temperature and -273.15 °C is called absolute zero.</p>

<li><h3>Acceleration (linear)</li></h3>
<p>Linear acceleration is defined as the uniform acceleration caused by a moving body in a straight line. There are three equations that are important in linear acceleration depending upon the parameters like initial and final velocity, displacement, time and acceleration.</p>

<li><h3>Acceleration due to gravity</li></h3>
<p>The gravity of Earth, denoted by g, is the net acceleration that is imparted to objects due to the combined effect of gravitation (from mass distribution within Earth) and the centrifugal force (from the Earth&#39s rotation).[2][3] It is a vector (physics) quantity, whose direction coincides with a plumb bob.</p>

<li><h3>Adiabatic process</li></h3>
<p>An adiabatic process is a thermodynamic change whereby no heat is exchanged between a system and its surroundings</p>

<li><h3>Aerofoil</li></h3>
<p>airfoil, also spelled Aerofoil, shaped surface, such as an airplane wing, tail, or propeller blade, that produces lift and drag when moved through the air. An airfoil produces a lifting force that acts at right angles to the airstream and a dragging force that acts in the same direction as the airstream.</p>

<li><h3>Amplitude</li></h3>
<p>displacement amplitude, in physics, the maximum displacement or distance moved by a point on a vibrating body or wave measured from its equilibrium position. It is equal to one-half the length of the vibration path.</p>

<li><h3>Air resistance</li></h3>
<p>Air resistance is a frictional force that air pushes against a moving object. It is also known as drag. Air resistance always tries to slows a moving object down. The faster you move, the greater the resistance.</p>

<li><h3>Angular Acceleration</li></h3>
<p>The angular acceleration is the time rate of change of the angular velocity and is usually designated by α and expressed in radians per second per second. For the case in which the angular velocity is uniform (nonvarying), θ = ωt and α = 0.</p>

<li><h3>Angular displacement</li></h3>
<p>Angular displacement of a body is the angle through which a point revolves around a centre or a specified axis in a specified sense. When a body rotates about its axis, the motion cannot simply be analyzed as a particle, as in circular motion it undergoes a changing velocity and acceleration at any time.</p>

<li><h3>Angular frequency</li></h3>
<p>In physics, angular frequency "ω" is a scalar measure of rotation rate. It refers to the angular displacement per unit time or the rate of change of the phase of a sinusoidal waveform, or as the rate of change of the argument of the sine function.</p>

<li><h3>Angular momentum</li></h3>
<p>In physics, angular momentum is the rotational analog of linear momentum. It is an important quantity in physics because it is a conserved quantity—the total angular momentum of a closed system remains constant. Angular momentum has both a direction and a magnitude, and both are conserved.</p>

<li><h3>Angular velocity</li></h3>
<p>angular velocity, time rate at which an object rotates, or revolves, about an axis, or at which the angular displacement between two bodies changes</p>

<li><h3>Angular wave number</li></h3>
<p>The angular wavenumber k = 2π/λ expresses the number of radians in a unit of distance.</p>

<li><h3>Antinodes</li></h3>
<p>An antinode is the location where constructive interference of the incoming and reflected waves creates the maximum amplitude of the wave. In contrast, a node is the location where destructive interference diminishes the wave amplitude to zero.</p>

<li><h3>Archimedes Principle</li></h3>
<p>Archimedes&#39 principle states that the upward buoyant force that is exerted on a body immersed in a fluid, whether fully or partially, is equal to the weight of the fluid that the body displaces. Archimedes&#39 principle is a law of physics fundamental to fluid mechanics. It was formulated by Archimedes of Syracuse.</p>

<li><h3>Atmospheric pressure</li></h3>
<p>Atmospheric pressure, also known as barometric pressure, is the pressure within the atmosphere of Earth. The standard atmosphere is a unit of pressure defined as 101,325 Pa, which is equivalent to 1013.25 millibars, 760 mm Hg, 29.9212 inches Hg, or 14.696 psi.</p>

<li><h3>Average acceleration</li></h3>
<p>Average acceleration refers to the rate at which the velocity changes. We divide the change in velocity by an elapsed time to find out the average acceleration of anything. For instance, if the velocity of a crazy ball increases from 0 to 60 cm/s in 3 seconds, the average acceleration of the ball would be 20 cm/s/s.</p>

<li><h3>Average speed</li></h3>
<p>Formula of Average Speed

The formula for average speed is found by calculating the ratio of the total distance traveled by the body to the time taken to cover that distance.</p>

<li><h3>Average velocity</li></h3>
<p>Velocity is the directional speed of an object in motion as an indication of its rate of change in position as observed from a particular frame of reference and as measured by a particular standard of time.</p>

<li><h3>Avogardo&#39s law</li></h3>
<p>Avogadro&#39s law, a statement that under the same conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of different gases contain an equal number of molecules. This empirical relation can be derived from the kinetic theory of gases under the assumption of a perfect.</p>
